    <p>Hello! My name is Bailey Stern, and I'm from San Francisco, California. Being from an area so well versed in technology, I have always been inspired to dive more into that world. I am currently a Creative Computing Major at Southern Methodist University. I hope to work in video game development once I graduate in 2026. I have coding, animating, and writing experience.I am currently taking CRCP3320 in order to widen my understanding of software applications and development. </p>
